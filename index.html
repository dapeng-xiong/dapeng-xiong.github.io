	<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Short Bio</p>
	<p>I am an Associate Professor in the School of Biological Science & Medical Engineering at Southeast University. I obtained my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University and subsequently conducted postdoctoral research at Cornell University. With a diverse academic background in Information and Computational Science, Computer Science and Technology, and Biology, my research focuses primarily on AI-driven computational biology. I have published numerous papers as first author or corresponding author in top-tier journals such as Nature Biotechnology, Pattern Recognition, and Communications Biology.</p>

	<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Research Interests</p>
	<p>Our lab is centered at the intersection of machine learning and life sciences, delving into cutting-edge fields, including artificial intelligence (AI), proteomics, genomics, and precision medicine. The primary objective is to develop algorithms to assist key areas such as protein structure and function, protein-related interactions, disease-associated mutations, and drug discovery. By uncovering fundamental biological processes and systematically unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, we seek to provide both theoretical insights and technical support for the development of therapeutics and personalized medicine.</p>
